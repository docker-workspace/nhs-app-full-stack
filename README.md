# nhs-app-full-stack

## backround
Moved from repo Docker-Workspace to org docker-workspace/nhs-app-full-stack

## Purpose
Used start/stop the app (every single tier) using kafka as message queueing system instead of mongo-connector.
Mongo connector didn't seem so reliable and poor performence wise.

## Note:
Other files in the old repo will move to the new org/repo on the need to add basis.
